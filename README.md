# HOLBERTON SCHOOL PRINTF PROJECT

This repository holds the code for a custom implementation of the `printf` function, a foundational project by the students of Holberton School. This custom `printf` mirrors the functionality of the standard C library `printf` function. The project is a collaborative effort between [Charlène SCOMPARIN](https://github.com/ChSPN) and [James JAROSZ](https://github.com/jmsjrz).
